A Distributed Approach to Trust and Expertise

Non-profits and social justice lobbying
Want to make a difference for prison reform, animal rights, etc
Who to support? Who to trust? Who watches the watchmen?
No good solution
--

Today I pulled out of my local New Seasons parking lot and saw a "No Crime, No Time" t-shirt advocating for sentencing reform. Sentencing reform is something I'm totally behind; our current system is badly broken and serving no one besides for profit prison providers contracted by the federal government. But this is a theory vs. practive divide for me. Have I donated money to ACLU? No. Participated in a march? Negative. Participated in a prison exchange program? Can't say I have. But before I beat myself up for not doing all I can, I want to defend myself by saying the number of worthy causes that should receive support >> (vastly exceeds) my bandwidth to educate myself. Given unlimited time and energy I could advocate for all worthy causes, but such time exists for no one.

Realistically, the best I can do is maximize the amount of change I effect in the world. This looks much harder than it is, since we live in a complex system that doesn't follow linear laws. Measuing impact via effort or dollars expended is not sufficient to accomplish real change. Imagine a US presidential election. I personally can raise $100 on my won for a presendential campaign, but the campaign will be far more successful if I can contribute $50 and get two other friends to contribute $50 each. This tradeoff between time and money means that I'm unavailable to focus on other causes.

Additionally, there's the problem of credibility. There are lots of non-profits, groups, lobbies competing for my attention, and I'd prefer a way to select donation recipients more objectively than who runs the best marketing campaign or has the most tear-jerking commercials. This is akin to attending a college based on a super bowl promo, or joining the Air Force because they have the flashiest recruitment campaign. Furthermore, even if a charity or non-profit is established as deserving high amounts of trust, changes in leadership, donors, or foci may make the organization less effective at reaching its goals and no longer a highly effective organization.

Currently there exists no good solution to this problem, but I believe we can borrow an approach from comptuter science to begin an introduction to dealing with this. Before introducing a potential solution, I want to demarcate the selection problem into three distinct components: limited bandwidth per individual; reliance on expertizse from experts; and incomplete knowledge about the on-the-ground effectiveness of such services.

Portals as the original mechanism for search
Want to learn about prison reform, animal rights, etc.
Curator's limited bandwidth obstacle to new sites and domains of knowledge. Who to trust. Who watches the curator
Solution: PageRank

An allegory from the World Wide Web

Yahoo! is now know as a search engine and has indeed had search support for most of its life. Interestingly, Yahoo!'s primary product was not search; it was portals for different subject areas. Portals were maintained ("curated") at the hands of subject matter experts at best to anyone trying to make copy at worst. This meant that one's jumping off point into the World Wide Web wasn't free-form and Google Search capable; it was carefully delinated by a major corporation who needed to ensure its portal links were meaningful for research, family friendly unless specifically categorized as adults only, and reliable enough to maintain its good standing in the days of fast-changing webpages.

Search worked fine. "Spiders" (automated computer programs) crawled the web, starting at one web page and noting all the key words, then moving to all that pages links and repeating the process. This worked, but meant that results had no real notion of importance -- every link is as valid as every other link.

The solution to the portal problem was to initially hire more curators. This proved intractable.

A couple graduate students from Stanford University developed a novel approach to the search problem. Instead of crawling the web for all key words, the spider would maintain a database of how often it encountered outbound links to a particular site. For instance, a blog referral may link to amazon.com, a Wired article may link to amazon.com, and a manufacturer may link to amazon.com as a way to buy their products. These three links count as three outbound hyperlinks, and improve the ranking of amazon.com. The key innovation of PageRank is its ability to *inherit* weights; for example, now that Amazon has three extra inbound links, it now lends higher credibility to every site that *it* links to. This is both a slightly obvious, everyday idea, and an extraordinary feat of engineering.
